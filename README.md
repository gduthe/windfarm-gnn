Multivariate GNN models for wind farm power performance and loads predictions


We develop and explore multivariate, system-wide approach based on graph neural networks (GNN) to predict wind farm wide power performance (average power and rotor averaged wind speed) and damage equivalent moments (DEL) in blade flap- and edgwise directions, along with tower top and tower bottom fore-aft and side-to-side. The use of a GNN is substantiated by it being able to take in consideration the topology-dependent interactions between turbines via wakes and allowing for a layout-agnostic multivariate model.
